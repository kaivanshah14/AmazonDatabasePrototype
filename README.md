# AmazonDatabasePrototype
This project is a small prototype of Amazon Database that was made mainly to understand the concepts of Database Management Systems or DBMS. With the help of Python and SQL, we were able to create a small database like Amazon that contains various user information such as their details, order history, and more.

One SQL file was used to create tables, while the other was used to insert specific data into the tables. For various properties, different constraints were given, and the table names were designed in such a way that they are easily understandable. As stated in the project report, the Entity-Relationship Diagram was created. All of the important features and tables have been clearly described, resulting in a comprehensive understanding.

To demonstrate how the prototype works, various Data Manipulation Queries were run on the database. To comprehend the core functioning of DML, many SQL concepts such as Joins, Cartesian Product, and Inner Queries were employed. The queries were created by connecting a cursor to a database using Python's Pandas module.
