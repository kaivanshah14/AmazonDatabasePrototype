# AmazonDatabasePrototype
This project is a small prototype of Amazon Database which was made mainly to understand the concepts of Database Management Systems or DBMS. With the help of Python and SQL we were able to create a small database like Amazon which contains various user information such as their personal details, order history and so on.
